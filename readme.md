## Philosophy of Learning
Our Master program emphasizes a **"building to learn"** approach, recognizing that the best way to master AI and entrepreneurship is by actively creating and iterating on projects. Rather than focusing solely on theory, we believe in:
- **Hands-on Exploration**: Students gain deeper insights when they roll up their sleeves and experiment with real-world data, tools, and coding challenges.  
- **Iterative Development**: Rapid prototyping and continual refinement foster adaptability and problem-solving skills.  
- **Collaborative Growth**: Sharing progress, receiving feedback, and working alongside peers accelerates both personal and communal learning.  

By encouraging students to build tangible solutions early and often, we seek to cultivate practical expertise, entrepreneurial thinking, and the confidence to innovate in an ever-changing technological landscape.
